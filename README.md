### house-prediction



Business Porblem: A machine learning model will be created using the data set with the features and price of each house.

Dataset: This dataset of residential homes in Lowa, Ames includes 79 explanatory variables. Since the dataset belongs to a kaggle competition, there are two different csv files, train and test. In the test dataset, house prices are empty, and you are expected to predict these values from the model.


In this regression problem, I used advanced decision trees like, CART, Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost and LightGBM.
